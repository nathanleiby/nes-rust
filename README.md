# nes-rust ("Muenster")

An emulator for the NES, written in Rust.

Priorities:

- WASM support from the start
- Try Bevy game engine for Frontend (audio, input, screen)
- Unit tested
- CI on commit: linting, unit tests, releases
- Try some Rust patterns for midsized projects... break up the repo into modules?
